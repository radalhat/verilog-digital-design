# Decoder (Gate-Level Modeling)

## Overview

This folder contains the gate-level implementation of 2×4 and 3×8 decoders using Verilog HDL gate primitives. Each design converts a binary input into one of several unique output lines, where only one output is active for each input combination.

## What is a Decoder?

A decoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts an n-bit binary input into one of 2ⁿ output lines. For every valid input combination, exactly one output is asserted HIGH while all remaining outputs remain LOW. Decoders are fundamental building blocks in digital systems for selecting devices, memory locations, and control signals.

## Gate-Level Modeling

Gate-level modeling describes a digital circuit by interconnecting Verilog gate primitives such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. This modeling style closely represents the physical hardware implementation and provides a clear understanding of the underlying logic connections.

## Implementations Included

- 2×4 Decoder
- 3×8 Decoder

Each implementation includes an individual testbench for functional verification.
