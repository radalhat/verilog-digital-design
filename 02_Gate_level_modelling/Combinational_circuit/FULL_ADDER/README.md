# Full Adder (Gate-Level Modeling)

## Overview

This folder contains the gate-level implementation of a Full Adder using Verilog HDL gate primitives. The design performs the addition of two single-bit binary inputs together with a carry input and produces the Sum and Carry outputs.

## What is a Full Adder?

A Full Adder is a combinational logic circuit that adds three single-bit binary values: two input bits and a carry input from a previous stage. It generates two outputs:

- **Sum (S)** – Represents the result of the addition.
- **Carry Out (Cout)** – Represents the carry generated for the next stage.

Full Adders are the fundamental building blocks of multi-bit binary adders.

## Gate-Level Modeling

Gate-level modeling describes a digital circuit by interconnecting Verilog gate primitives such as `xor`, `and`, and `or`. This modeling style closely represents the actual hardware implementation and provides a clear understanding of the circuit's logic.

## Implementations Included

- Full Adder

The implementation includes an individual testbench for functional verification.
